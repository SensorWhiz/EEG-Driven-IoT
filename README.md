# EEG-Driven-IoT
This project introduces a brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to control household electrical appliances using non-invasive EEG signals. The primary objective is to enable hands-free, intuitive control of an AC bulb based on a user's mental state— specifically focus and relaxation—making the system especially beneficial for individuals with limited motor abilities. EEG signals are acquired using a headband with electrodes placed at standard positions: Fp1, Fp2, and behind the ear, which are effective in capturing frontal lobe activity associated with cognitive intent.
