# EEG-Driven-IoT
This project introduces a brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to control household electrical appliances using non-invasive EEG signals. The primary objective is to enable hands-free, intuitive control of an AC bulb based on a user's mental state— specifically focus and relaxation—making the system especially beneficial for individuals with limited motor abilities. EEG signals are acquired using a headband with electrodes placed at standard positions: Fp1, Fp2, and behind the ear, which are effective in capturing frontal lobe activity associated with cognitive intent.These lowamplitude signals are first amplified using the BioAmp EXG Pill, ensuring signal clarity and strength for further processing.  The amplified EEG data is transmitted to an Arduino Nano, which digitizes the signals and communicates them to a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ over UART. The Raspberry Pi functions as the central processing unit and hosts a pre-trained machine learning model, developed to classify mental states in real time. Based on the model's prediction, the Pi issues appropriate control commands to a relay module connected to the Arduino, enabling or disabling an AC bulb accordingly. A 16x2 LCD display, also driven by the Raspberry Pi, provides real-time visual feedback on classification results and system status, enhancing interactivity and system transparency for the user.
